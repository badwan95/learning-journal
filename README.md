Growth mindset is the mindset that allows you to be the most productive version of yourself, it encourages you to take criticism and try to improve that part that was criticized, your main goal is to improve yourself and be a better person than you were in the past, and it's a never stopping journey.

How to maintain growth mindset:
1. *Try different learning tactics.*
2. *Value the process over the end result*
3. ***Stop** seeking approval.*
