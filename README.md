Growth mindset is the mindset that allows you to be the most productive version of your self, it encourages you to take criticism and try to improve that part that was criticized

How to maintain growth mindset:
1. *Try different learning tactics.*
2. *Value the process over the end result*
3. ***Stop** seeking approval.*
