# Computer architecture and logic

* Computers are a huge part of our life, they are everywhere.

Computers came to help us in thinking process just like physical tools help us in the physical process.

The 4 things that are common for all computers are: input, storage, processing and output.

Old computers were made using wood and leather with mechanical parts.
input are thing that tell the computer what to do

Storage stores the information generated from input, then it gets processed by algorithms until its ready to output it.

Output includes text, photos, videos, games etc...

Computers work on binary, as 0 means no current that means off, and 1 means current goes in and that means yes, this is called bit.

binary system differs from decimal system by the fact that instead of multiplying by 10 every time, it multiplies by 2.

All files are binary in origin, including text, music, videos etc...

Computers got a lot of tiny electronic components called cicruits

Some types of circuits are: "and" circuit that requires both connections to be on for it to put out an on or a 1

"not" circuit and if it gets an on, it turns it off and vice versa

connecting those simple circuits together can make more complex calculations

Circuits are too fast 

Software works with hardware to give us what we want.

Coding languages are like a bridge between human language and computers
