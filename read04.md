# Structure web pages with HTML

* A website should be designed with one question in mind, who is it for? if its for an individual, then you should ask aaquestions about your target audience like: 
1- What is their age range?

2- Which countries your visitors live in?

3- What is the average income for them?

and many many more questions that help you define your target demographic, and if its a company then ask questions like how big is their company? what is the company's budget?

* Site maps lets you plan website structure

* Wireframe organizes the information on each page

* Differentiate between information using size, color and style.

**HTML 5**

HTML5 introduced new elements that allows you to divide up parts of the page, and they are named to indicate their purpose.

Main header is the highest level of importance in a web page, it also helps with search engine optimization.

Main parts of the new HTML5 code is: 

> <nav>
it contains major navigational blocks on the site

> <article>
It's a place to put text in, like a paragraph.

> <div>

its still important to use this to group together related elements.

* We can help older browsers understand HTML5 code even thought they treat it like an inline element, you need to use a simple javascript known as html5shiv, this does not work on IE8 or earlier, except if you have extra javascript.
