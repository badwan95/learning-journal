# Operators and Loops

## Comparison operators: Evaluating conditions

Equal == returns true if a value is the same, wether its string, number or a boolean

Strict equal to === ; it checks for both data type and value

NOT equal != it gives false if the value of the string/number/boolean equals eachother

strict NOT equal !== ; checks both data type and value to see if they are not the same.

greater than > , less than < , greater than or equal >= , less than or equal <=

## Logical Operators:
Logical and **&&** ,if one value is false then it returns a true.

Logical or **||** ,if one value is true, then it returns a true.

Logical NOT **!** , it takes the boolean answer and inverts it.

## Loops

Loops check condition, if it returns a true, then code block will run, then after its done if its still true,then it runs it again
1- For loop: if you use it, it will run the code a specific number of times.
2- While: you use it when you dont know how many times you need the code to run
3- Do While; its similiar to while except it will run every code that it has inside the curly brackets.

For loop uses counter as condition

first part is the initialization; var i=0

second part is condition; < 10

third part is the update, i++ (double plus means an increment of 1)

example: you can do while loop for our quizes, you dont know how many times you should try them, but only stop when you get 5 marks.
