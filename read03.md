# Revisions and the cloud

## Git 

**Git** is a way to share code between multiple people, its a version control system.

Snapshots are commits that are basically "save as" in other programs, every commit has an ID and a label (a message to define what you changed)

**You must follow the A-C-P way; add, commit and push.**

* Typical commands in git terminal:

> git clone URL

After cloning, you would have downloaded the repository locally.

> code .

> git status

> git add filename

> git commit -m "your message"

> git push origin master
