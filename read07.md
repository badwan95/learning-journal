# Programming with JavaScript

You need to know the vocabulary and structure of sentences in JS just like any new language you learn.

You can access and modify the content of the HTML webpage using javascript, program rules and instructions for the browser to follow and react to the events of the browser or the user.

jQuery helps with inconsistencies among different browsers.

* Scripts are set of instructions that your computer follows step by step.
Always start with a big picture and a plan on how to design your JS, first part of writing a script is stating your goal and the tasks that are needed to complete them, and then start coding each step.

Scripts can use only a subset of all the instructions.

## Expressions

* Expressions evaluates into a single value.

Two types of expressions: one that assins a value to a variable, other uses two or more variables to return a single value.

Expressions rely on operators to work, they allow programmers to create a single value out of one or more values.

Examples for operators include: arithmetic for numbers, assignment operators to assign a variable, string operator to combine two or more strings

* Arithmetic operators; arithmetic operators inlude: **" +, -, *, /, ++ (increment), -- (decrement), % (modulus; it divides and return the remaining value)".**

order of execution goes first to multiplication and division, then addition and subtraction, you can change the order of execution by using parenthisis () in the operation you want to do first.

* There is one single operator for strings and that is addition (+) 

you can convert a string with a numerical value to a number by 
> b = Number(b);

## Functions: they let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task so that you dont repeat steps.

u can use it like this:
> function functionName(parameters) {
    something;
}
