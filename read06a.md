# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

Javascript is a programming language that makes a website dynamic, it's one of the best programming languages and it's always improving

its best to create seperate javascript file and then link it to an HTML file using script element and linking it with a javascript file

javascript files will run in the place they were placed inside on the html site

javascript syntax consists of objects and methods and its called ***Statement***

an example is document.write("hello!");

where document is an object, the dot is member operator and the rest is method (while hello only is a parameter)

* Javascript is case sensitive

to add a comment in JS, you have to: 

> // for single line comments
> /* */ for multiple line comments

* To use variables, do var name = value;

it can hold numerical values, or letters (they are called **strings** ) if you use them between '' single line quotes, and a boolean (true or false) 

variables cant start with a number, only letters, $ sign or underscore, also dont use dash - or dot . in a variable name

variables are case sensitive
